# Christmas-Project
A christmas project which includes two mini-games for you to play. The first one features baubles generating in random places on a tree until it is fully decorated. The second one involves you setting baubles on the christmas tree yourself. In the second mini-game, if you go out of bounds of the tree, you lose. Also, if your bauble "steps" on a bauble you already placed, the game will be over. After each time mini-game successfully completes, it stores your scores in .txt files which are generated after each go. Have fun.
